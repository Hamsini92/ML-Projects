1. LSTM: This file generates plausible text sequences for a given problem suing LSTM. It uses LSTM layer with 256 memory units. The network uses dropout with a probability of 20. The output layer is a Dense layer using the softmax activation function to output a probability prediction for each of the 63 characters between 0 and 1.
